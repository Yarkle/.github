As of writing, the only way to contact us is through issues, pull requests or discussions, but you can also contact me on [Discord](https://discord.com/): [@andriemc](https://discord.com/users/662912619975278592),
but we are planning to make a Discord server at some point, and maybe even a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/)
